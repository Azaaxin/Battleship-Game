# Battleship-Game
A C++ game I made when I studied Programming 1. This game was a keystone for me to get "A" in the course.

This game/program is written for Windows and might not work on other operating systems without changing the source code, with exceptions 
for programs like Wine.

# The Game
First you type out the size of the playground. Y Size then X Size, up to 27.

Then you guess coordinates and if you hit, you win. It might not be traditional Battleship but it is something.
